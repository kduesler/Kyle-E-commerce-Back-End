## Installation
Youâ€™ll need to use the [MySQL2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2) and [Sequelize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize) packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database and the [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to use environment variables to store sensitive data, like your MySQL username, password, and database name.

Use the schema.sql file in the db folder to create your database using MySQL shell commands. Use environment variables to store sensitive data, like your MySQL username, password, and database name.

## Usage
1. Create the schema from MySQL shell using the following command 'mysql -u root -p'. Enter your MySQL password.

2. Source the schema page with the command 'SOURCE db/schema.sql' and exit the MySQL shell with the command 'exit'.

3. Seed the database using the command 'npm run seed'.

4. Use Insomnia or any other API development platform to test the view, add, update and delete functionality using the routes found in the Routes folder.
